Setup
-----

1) Install the LitleOnline PHP SDK from git. 

>git clone git://github.com/LitleCo/litle-sdk-for-php.git


2) Once the SDK is downloaded run our setup program to generate a configuration file.

> cd litle-sdk-for-php/lib
>php Setup.php

Running the above commands will create a configuration file in the lib directory. 

3.) Create a php file similar to:  

```php
require 'LitleOnline'

# Visa $10 Sale
litleSaleTxn = {
    'reportGroup'=>'rpt_grp',
    'orderId'=>'1234567',
    'card'=>{
        'type'=>'VI',
        'number' =>'4100000000000001',
        'expDate' =>'1212'},
        'orderSource'=>'ecommerce',
        'amount'=>'1000'
    }

# Peform the transaction on the Litle Platform
response = LitleOnlineRequest.sale(litleSaleTxn)

# display result
puts "Message: "+ response.message
puts "Litle Transaction ID: "+ response.saleResponse.litleTxnId
```

3) Next run this file using ruby. You should see the following result provided you have connectivity to the Litle certification environment.  You will see an HTTP error if you don't have access to the Litle URL

    Message: Valid Format
    Litle Transaction ID: <your-numeric-litle-txn-id>
